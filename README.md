# DataScienceProject
This repository presents a Data Science project developed as part of a 6-month Bootcamp in the field. The project utilizes retail data to perform data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), RFM analysis, and training of three models: Customer Segmentation, Recommendation System, and Sales Prediction

1. **Customer Clustering:** This model segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

2. **Product Recommendation System:** This system leverages collaborative filtering with implicit feedback to recommend products to customers.

3. **Sales Prediction Model:** This model aims to predict future sales; however, the dataset was found to be insufficient to achieve satisfactory results.

**Dataset:** The dataset used in this project is a retail dataset containing customer purchase history data.
